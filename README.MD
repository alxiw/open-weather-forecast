# Open Weather Forecast

An Android application that serves as a wrapper for the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and implements the [recommended app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#recommended-app-arch) using MVVM and Repository patterns, [Realm](https://realm.io/) database, and some of the [Android Architecture Components](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples), such as ViewModel, ViewBinding, and WorkManager. The application fetches a 5-day weather forecast for every 3 hours to provide the information for the location that you typed into the search field.
