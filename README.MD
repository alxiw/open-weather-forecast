# Open Weather Forecast

An Android application which represents a wrapper for [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and implemented using the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#recommended-app-arch) and [Repository](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide#recommended-app-arch) patterns, [Realm](https://realm.io/) database, and some of [Android Architecture Components](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components), such as [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel). The application fetches 5-day weather forecast for every 3 hours to provide it for the location, that you typed at the search field.
